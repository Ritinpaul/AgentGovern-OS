"""
Meta Crew Agent Definitions — 4 governance oversight agents.

Agent 6: Historian (performance drift analysis)
Agent 7: Gene Auditor (DNA integrity & inheritance)
Agent 8: Red Teamer (adversarial vulnerability testing)
Agent 9: Compliance Synthesizer (regulatory → executable rules)

These agents run asynchronously on schedules and triggers, NOT per-dispute.
